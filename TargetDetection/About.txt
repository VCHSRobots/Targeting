# The code for detecting the goal, and drawing on the image was created by Kevin Brandon. (Thanks!) #
# The rest of the code was created by the EpicRobotz Admin Web team.                                #

This directory, TargetDetection, is used for Goal Tracking, and detection.
The script TargetDetect.py takes images, analizes them, and then places them into this directory.
From there, it sends information about those images to a RoboRio, and to a Driver Console.
Information is sent as follows:

Send start of transmission feed character "@" to the RoboRio.
Format is: "@(X,Y)(X,Y)(X,Y)#", with "@" indicating the start of a transmission feed, and "()" marking individual "packets" of information; in this case, X and Y values, conveying the position of the robot in relation to the center of the goal.
"#" indicates the end of a transmission feed, and is sent when the program is halted.

There are two functions which have to do with communication: "CommOutbound", and "CommInbound".
Their syntax is as follows:

-	CommOutbound(recipiant, message)
	
	Recipiant may one be the following:
		RPiConsole	-	Send a message to the Raspberry Pi's console
		RoboRio		-	Send a message to the RoboRio
		Op			-	Send a message to the Operator / Driver console
	ALL messages sent are recorded in the log as follows: "TIME&DATE [INFO] Communication stream : Sender --> Recipiant: Message"
	Example: 18:12:05 [INFO] Communication stream: Pi --> RoboRio: (7,12)
	
-	CommInbound(sender, mode, value)
	
	Sender may be one of the following:
		RoboRio		-	Use this if listening for messages from the RoboRio only
		Op			-	Use this if listening for messages from the Operator / Driver console only
		All			-	Use this if listening for messages from any sender
		
	Mode may be one of the following:
		Time		-	Listen for an amount of time; specified by the "value" variable.
		Number		-	Listen for a certain number of responses, then stop listening; specified by the "value" variable.

	Value:
		(An interger with a value ranging from -1 to 8.64e+7)
			When used with "time":
				Time period is in milliseconds, so 1000 would equal one second. The maximum time period is approx. 24 hours, or 8.64e+7 (86,400,000) milliseconds. To listen indefinitly, enter a value of "-1".
			When used with "number":
				Indicates the number of messages to recieve before stopping listening. Maximum number of messages is approx. 8.64e+7 (86,400,000). To listen indefinitly, enter a value of "-1".

	CommInbound can also interprets special commands that are sent to it. Here are the commands which it can understand:
		"halt"		-	Halt the execution of the program; only can be understood if sender is "Op".
		"download"	-	Send a copy of the log file; and then pictures, to the Operator console; only can be understood if sender is "Op".

The log file records all events which take place in the program, along with a date stamp.

With program messages, there are a few prefixes:
	[INFO]	-	General information message
	[WARN]	-	Similar to [INFO], but a warning message
	[FATL]	-	Is used when something has gone horribly wrong

The targetdetectconfiguration.conf file is a file used for setting the default configuration of the program.
It includes instructions for how to change settings, and what each setting effects.
