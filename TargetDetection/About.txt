This directory, TargetDetection, is used for Goal Tracking, and detection.
The script TargetDetect.py takes images, analizes them, and places them into this directory.
It then passes information from those images to a RoboRio.
The code for detecting the goal in the TargetDetect.py file is courtesy of Kevin Brandon.
The remainder of the code was created by the EpicRobotz Admin Web team.
