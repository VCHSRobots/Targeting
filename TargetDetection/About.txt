# The code for detecting the goal, and drawing on the image was created by Kevin Brandon. (Thanks!) #
# The rest of the code was created by the EpicRobotz Admin Web team.                                #

This directory, TargetDetection, is used for Goal Tracking, and detection.
The script TargetDetect.py takes images, analizes them, and then places them into this directory.
From there, it sends information about those images to a RoboRio, and to a Driver Console.
Information is sent as follows:

Send start of transmission feed character "@" to the RoboRio.
Roborio should respond saying that it is ready to recieve data.
Format is: "SenderName(X,Y)(X,Y)(X,Y)#", with "()" marking individual "packets" of information; in this case, X and Y values, conveying the position of the robot in relation to the center of the goal.
"#" indicates the end of a transmission feed, and is sent when the program is halted.
Text prefixed with a "/" means that that text should be interpreted as a command.

There are two functions which have to do with communication: "CommOutbound", and "CommInbound".

	CommOutbound() has the following syntax options:
		CommOutbound(recipiant, message)
	Recipiant can be one of the following:
		RPiConsole	-	The Raspberry Pi's console
		RoboRio		-	The RoboRio module
		OpConsole	-	The Operator / Driver program
	Message *must* be a string of text.

<Extra syntax options for CommInbound() removed as considered un-needed for program execution.>

CommInbound interprets special commands that are sent to it. Here are the commands which it can understand:
"/go"		-	Start the execution of the main body of the program.
"/halt"		-	Halt the execution of the program.
"/download"	-	Send a copy of the log file; and then pictures, to the Operator console.
"/viewgo"	-	Start transmitting live images to the Operator console.
"/viewhalt"	-	Stop transmitting live images to the Operator console.
"/change"	-	Change settings on-the-fly.

	"/change" has a special syntax of its own. It is as follows:

		/change:drawThresh,useAdaptive,thresh,minPerim,autoShutter,eps,aspect,aspectTol,adaptiveSize

	ALL of these values must be positive real integers.
	drawThresh	-	Draw Threshold on image? Can be a 1 or a 0.
	useAdaptive	-	Use adaptive threshold? Can be a 1 or a 0.
	thresh		-	Set the threshold value. Can be anywhere from 1 - 1000
	minPerim	-	Set the minimum perimiter of a valid target (in pixel length). Can be anywhere from 1 to 1000.
	autoShutter	-	Set the target average pixel value in the image, used to set the shutter speed. (From 1 to 1000)
	eps		-	Set the max angle we can be off for horizontal and verticle value: (1 to 100)
	aspect		-	Set the aspect ratio of the target (width / height) (Anywhere from 1 to 100)
	aspectTol	-	Set the aspect ratio tolerance in percetage (From 1 to 100)
	adaptiveSize	-	Set adaptive threshold size. (From 3 to 100)


The log file records all events which take place in the program, along with a date stamp.

With program messages, there are a few prefixes:
	[INFO]	-	General information message
	[WARN]	-	Similar to [INFO], but a warning message
	[FATL]	-	Is used when something has gone horribly wrong!

We are using port 5800 for communication reasons.

The targetdetectconfiguration.conf file is a file used for setting the default configuration of the program.
It includes instructions for how to change settings, and what each setting effects.
